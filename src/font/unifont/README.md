## News
At this moment, [Noto] (https://www.google.com/get/noto/) gives better support to all languages, with more characters and fewer bugs, and it covers many more languages.
For that reason, the Roboto font is superseded by NotoSansExtended which include several NotoSans fonts:
	- [Noto Sans (Coverage 582 languages)](https://www.google.com/get/noto/#sans-lgc)
	- [Noto Sans CJK SC(Coverage 9 languages)](https://www.google.com/get/noto/#sans-hans)

NOTE: From Noto Sans CJK SC were excluded Korean glyphs (Hangul font family), because the number of gliphs limited by 65535.
